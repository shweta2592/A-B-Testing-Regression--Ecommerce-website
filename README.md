# A-B-Testing-Regression--Ecommerce-website

<h3>Introduction:</h3>
The project consisted of around 30k records depicting if the user lands on a new page or an old page of an ecommerce website.
The main goal was to implement an A/B test by the ecommerce company and help the company understand through statistical conclusions, if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

<b><br>Language Used</b> : Python</br>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>Practice working on A/B testing projects and their practical difficulties
<ul>perform A/B tests and make recommendations backed by computed inferences
  
<h3>Steps followed </h3>  
1. Data Wrangling:<br>
<ul>remove duplicates or records with missing or mismatched values</ul>
<ul>handle the rows where the landing_page and group columns don't align</ul>

2.<b> Data Analytics </b>:
<ul>Compute probabilities of converting:
  1.regardless of page.
  2.Given that an individual received the treatment
  3.Given that an individual received the control page</ul>
<ul>Perform Hypothesis Testing and calculate p-values</ul>
<ul>Conduct Logistic Regression</ul>
